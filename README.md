# restrained-ensemble molecular dynamics
MPI C++ code for driving restrained-ensemble simulations using a modified version of the method described in https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp3110369.
This package must be compiled against a modified version of GROMACS which can be found at https://github.com/jmhays/reMD-gromacs-5.2.git
